    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "Your upcoming trip to AgentsVille features two travelers: Yuri, age 30, who enjoys tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, and Hiro, age 25, who has interests in reading, music, theatre, and art. The trip is scheduled from June 10 to June 12, 2025, with a total planned budget of 130, while the final itinerary has a total cost of 100. The activities selected align closely with both travelers' interests, offering a mix of indoor and outdoor engagements suited to the weather and individual preferences.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10, the weather is expected to be clear with a warm temperature of 31°C, making it an ideal day to start with the FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up held indoors at The Innovation Atrium in the Tech District. This morning event perfectly matches Yuri’s enthusiasm for technology and offers a dynamic setting for networking and exploring the latest in tech trends. Later in the afternoon, the Artful Athletics: Paint & Play Extravaganza provides a unique combination of art and sports at Creative Courts Park. This outdoor event engages Hiro’s love of art and Yuri’s interest in sports—especially tennis—and encourages creativity and active participation in a lively atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 11, with partly cloudy skies and a hotter temperature of 34°C, the day begins indoors at the Morning Groove Dance Party in Rhythm Hall, a lively event that resonates with Hiro’s passion for music and dance while also fitting well with fitness interests. Midday, the Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers at The Digital Atrium will captivate Yuri with discussions on artificial intelligence and technology innovation. This indoor event is a great way to continue the day with engaging, tech-centered content while remaining comfortable out of the heat.\n",
       "\n",
       "June 12 brings thunderstorms and cooler weather at 28°C. The itinerary emphasizes indoor activities to ensure enjoyment despite the inclement conditions. In the evening, Yuri and Hiro have two complementary choices: the AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape, a cozy indoor writing and storytelling event that aligns with Hiro’s interests in writing, reading, and art; and the Tech & Film Fusion Night at the Virtual Reality Theater, which merges technology and movies for a captivating experience that connects with both Yuri’s fascination with technology and Hiro’s appreciation of film. These events provide a perfect creative and immersive conclusion to their visit.\n",

       "This thoughtfully crafted itinerary ensures a balanced blend of interests, comfortable settings, and engaging experiences tailored to both travelers, maximizing their enjoyment throughout their stay in AgentsVille."
